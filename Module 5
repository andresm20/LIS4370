#Module 5
#For this weeks assignment we were instructed to creat two matrix's and find the value of inverse and determinant for the
#following matrix's

A <- matrix(1:100, nrow = 10)
B <- matrix(1:1000, nrow = 10)
print(A)
print(B)

#To calculate a martix's inverse, the matrix must be a square. the only matrix that is a square, is matrix A.
#To find the inverse I used the solve() function:

inverse_A <- solve(A)

#output:
> inverse_A <- solve(A)
Error in solve.default(A) : 
  Lapack routine dgesv: system is exactly singular: U[6,6] = 0

#after using the solve() function on A, the output stated that the system is exactly singular so there is no inverse
#when a matrix is singular it means that the Determinant is equal to zero, to test that I will be using the det() function

deter_A <- det(A)
print(deter_A)

#output: [1] 0

#just to test the function on matrix B, this is the result you get after you use the solve() function on a matrix that is not a square
inverse_B <- solve(B)

#output: 
Error in solve.default(B) : 'a' (10 x 100) must be square
