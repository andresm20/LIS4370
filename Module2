#Module # 2
##Given## 
assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
myMean <- function(assignment2) { return(sum(assignment)/length(someData)) } 
meanValue <- myMean(assignment2)

##Console output##
> assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
> myMean <- function(assignment2) { return(sum(assignment)/length(someData)) } 
> meanValue <- myMean(assignment2)
Error in myMean(assignment2) : object 'assignment' not found


######The fuction given for this assignment has a few issues that can be adjusted so it works succesfully
the sum function is calling "assignmnet" instead of "assignmnet2" and the length function called "someData" when it should
be calling "assignment2". Fixing that would fix the code. Below is the correct code.#######

##correct##
myMean2 <- function(assignment2) { return(sum(assignment2)/ length(assignment2)) }
meanValue2 <- myMean2(assignment2)
print(meanValue2)

##Console output##
> myMean2 <- function(assignment2) { return(sum(assignment2)/ length(assignment2)) }
> meanValue2 <- myMean2(assignment2)
> source("~/.active-rstudio-document", echo=TRUE)
> print(meanValue2)
