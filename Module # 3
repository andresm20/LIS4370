 

    ###For module 3 we were given a data set based on the presidential election during 2016, then asked to plug it in into R code and analyze the results.
Below is the code given in the assignment:  
 
Name <- c("Jeb", “Donald”, "Ted”, “Marco” “Carly”, “Hillary”, “Berine”)
ABC political poll results <- c(4, 62 51, 21, 2, 14, 15)
CBS political poll results <- c(12, 75, 43, 19, 1, 21, 19) 
 
###First line: 
> Name <- c("Jeb", “Donald”, "Ted”, “Marco” “Carly”, “Hillary”, “Berine”)
 
###To begin with, the first line of code has a few errors that prevented me from continuing. For starters, some of the quotation marks are straight quotes and curly quotes which will cause errors, also there is a few missing commas missing between Marco and Carley.

###Second and third line:
> ABC political poll results <- c(4, 62 51, 21, 2, 14, 15)
> CBS political poll results <- c(12, 75, 43, 19, 1, 21, 19)

 ##These two lines have the same error, both object names have spaces which will automatically cause errors, and a couple of numbers are missing commas.


###Below is the correct code:

>Name <- c("Jeb", "Donald", "Ted", "Marco", "Carly", "Hillary", "Bernie")
>ABC_political_poll_results <- c(4, 62, 51, 21, 2, 14, 15)
>CBS_political_poll_results <- c(12, 75, 43, 19, 1, 21, 19)
