##For module 4 we were given a data that was collected by the local hospital, with 5 variables based on 10 patients. 
##We were asked to organize the data correctly and then create a side by side box plot and histogram.

# With the data Iw as given, I created the following vectors

Freq <- c(0.6, 0.3, 0.4, 0.4, 0.2, 0.6, 0.3, 0.4, 0.9, 0.2)
bloodp <- c(103, 87, 32, 42, 59, 109, 78, 205, 135,176)
first <- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 1)
second <- c(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1)
finaldecision <- c(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1)

# turned the data into a data.frame so it is easier to manipulate

data <- data.frame(Freq, bloodp, first, second, finaldecision)
print(data)

# Creating boxplots for Blood pressure and Frequency 

boxplot( data$bloodp,
         main = "Boxplot of Blood Pressure",
         ylab = "Blood Pressure")
boxplot(data$Freq,
        main = "Frequency of visits to hospital in the last 12 months.",
        ylab = " Frequency")

#Crating a histogram for Blood pressure and Frequency 

hist(data$bloodp,
     main = "Blood Pressure graph for 10 patience",
     xlab = "Blood Pressure")
hist(data$Freq,
     main = "Frequency of visits to hospital in the last 12 months.",
     xlab = "Visits",
     ylab = "Frequency for 12 months")

#By comparing these graphs, this data is more appropriately visualized using a histogram rather than a box plot. 
#A histogram provides a clearer representation of data over a time period,making it easier to interpret the distribution along the X-axis.
